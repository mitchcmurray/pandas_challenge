Based on this analysis we can conclude that, on average, charter schools have a higher rate of students who pass math and reading across the board. Budget does not seem to have effect on the passing rate since even the schools with the lowest passing rates have higher budget per capita than some of the highest rated schools. Size seems to play a factor as well since the larger schools have significant lower percentage passing, where the small and medium size schools seem to be around the same.
